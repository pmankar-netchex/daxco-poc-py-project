## Payroll integration app

- Endpoint 1- Incoming web hook (Rest API) Requirements
    - Query parameters
        - companyId - integer
        - Integration_type - string
        - integration_provider - string
    - Accept CSV file as input
    - Select correct configuration/orchestration file as per selected provider (Mock value for integration_type=payroll, integration_provider = Daxco)
    - Different stages supported for orchestration
        - csv_parser
            - Input: csv_file
            - Output: json_object
            - Validation: accept only csv/xlsx, don’t accept file more than 2MB
        - fetch_employees
            - Input: companyId
            - output: employee object
            - Make GET call - curl -X 'GET' \ 'https://tequila-employee-api-primary.azurewebsites.net/api/v3/Employees?companyId=4394' \-H 'accept: application/json' \ -H 'Netchex-Shared-Key: ajZoalNWbVghZ3RtNFAlbUhEcVB5M0I2XlEyWG1YJF4'
            - Keep only firstName,LastName,EmployeeId in employee_object
            - Use companyId from the input query parameter
        - daxco_file_transformation
            - Input: json_object (from csv_parser stage)
            - Output: json_object
            - Use @input_format.csv, and convert it into @output_format.csv in this code
            - Use employee object from “fetch_employees” stage
            - User first_name and last_name in the input json object, search for employee in the employee_object return employee_code value, and add that into transformed output object
        - validate_transformation
            - Input json_object (from daxco_file_transformation stage)
            - Output json_object with validation object per cell
            - Compute for each cell where value is valid or not
            - If value is invalid give an array of possible values for user to select from
            - For e.g. if employee is not found say row is not valid with empty array, multiple employees are found show list of all possible employee_codes for user to select from
            - If employee_code is not already empty, then check if code already belongs to employee_object if yes then valid row else not valid row
            - Give overall validate option at the main object level (true only if all the cells are valid)
- Endpoint 2- Validate and download endpoint
        - fetch_employees (same as endpoint 1)
            - Input: companyId
            - output: employee object
            - Make GET call - curl -X 'GET' \ 'https://tequila-employee-api-primary.azurewebsites.net/api/v3/Employees?companyId=4394' \-H 'accept: application/json' \ -H 'Netchex-Shared-Key: ajZoalNWbVghZ3RtNFAlbUhEcVB5M0I2XlEyWG1YJF4'
            - Keep only firstName,LastName,EmployeeId in employee_object
            - Use companyId from the input query parameter
            - This maybe required as requests are not linked
        - validate_transformation (use same function for both the endpoints to avoid rework)
            - Expect input as output from validate_transformation stage in endpoint 1
            - Do same/similar validation again
            - Output would be similar json__object with validation information
            - Purpose of this endpoint is to revalidate without needing to do transformations again
    - Endpoint 3 - Download CSV
        - download_csv
            - Expect input json_object which will be output from validate_transformation
            - Ignore validation objects, convert this object into csv and download csv
